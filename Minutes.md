- Decentralised system of contracts and institutions is an interesting parallel to Blockchain

- Large direction
- change in bank securitisation before and after financial crisis
- intersection between macroeconomic policy and finance: exchange rate as an industrial policy; financial regulation is also very interesting. see what the economic implication is, financial or macroeconomic(fiscal/monetary) policy --> sector/bank response --> wider implication to the economy on output, productivity, innovation etc

   - look at filters they imposed and their justifications.
   - look at options with different windows, calls and puts, with different expiration dates. 
3) Familiarise with (pref Longitude and latitude) data from Reference USA and Redivis, headquarter location measure, check data quality for firms by year, preferably look at all establishments
5) Check Reference USA for duration of data covered, focus on 2010-14 but also check if 2020-24 data is avaliable  
6) Years ending in 2, new way district representation divided, focus on 2010-14, time period 2014, every 10 years redistricting with every census, Reference USA see if the timeline is long enough, also consider 2024.

# 13 Aug: Matt and Raymond
- Paper on Senator's death, correspondance Boeing's operations and redistricting; have rationale of using establishments, also okay with just looking at headquarters
- Optionmetrics: binscatter of new and old data 
- Negative IV value is relative to -30 day
- level effect and moment effect, some network effect, not redistricted, then IV
  - what is the definition of "effect" when is day 0, do people already know when the boundaries be drawn, (but how do people know?)
  - question of t-30 day anchoring, as something to note, but not go all the way back
- treated defined as redistricting or network effect in IV or returns regressions
- consider: same politician same district; same politician diff district; diff politician same distrinct; diff politican diff district
- running in the area of greatest overlap?
