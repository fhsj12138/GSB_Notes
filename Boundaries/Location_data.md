### 2001-2016
- 3 pairs of lat long, some small difference in the hundredth digit after decimal even in same year's observation, call to ask them the difference?
- ABI does not uniquely identify a company, changes with a different year's filing, company name is better identifier, or use zip code to merge with compustat etc for a GVKEY?

### 2017
- ABI mostly uniquely identify company
- CLean, usable, lat long with year recorded, scope: 2020 onwards
- check if data download is possible, else use integrated R
