### Direction
- Choose macro as of now as could be useful for writing a thesis
- Micro is perhaps better for signalling but not useful for thesis/research paper
- GRE exams coming up, 
- AWSS, can take 4 courses, before application season. hopefully 4 to rewrite my masters outcome 

### Points to raise 
- want to take a course because of more research exposure
- want the signalling, masters result is imperfect, want to do macro related research, need to rewrite
-
