### Direction
- Choose macro as of now as could be useful for writing a thesis
- Micro is perhaps better for signalling but not useful for thesis/research paper
- GRE exams coming up, 
- AWSS, can take 4 courses, before application season. hopefully 4 to rewrite my masters outcome 

### Points to raise 
- want to take a course because of more research exposure
- want the signalling, masters result is imperfect, want to do macro related research, need to rewrite
- 

### Course list 
- MATH 115: Functions of a Real Variable
The development of 1-dimensional real analysis (the logical framework for why calculus works): sequences and series, limits, continuous functions, derivatives, integrals. Basic point set topology. Includes introduction to proof-writing. Prerequisite: Math 51 or Math 56.
Terms: Aut, Win, Spr | Units: 4 | UG Reqs: GER:DB-Math, WAY-FR
- ECON 233: Advanced Macroeconomics I
Topics in the theory and empirics of economic growth. For PhD-level students.
Terms: Aut | Units: 2-5
Instructors: Jones, C. (PI) ; Klenow, P. (SI)
Schedule for ECON 233
- MGTECON 610: Macroeconomics
This course covers various topics in macroeconomics and is designed to expose students to macroeconomic methods, classic papers in the field, and the latest research at the frontier. The current focus is on economic growth. Using theoretical and empirical tools, we consider questions like: How do we understand long-run growth in per capita income? Why are some countries so much richer than others? Other topics include misallocation as a source of TFP differences, the direction of technical change, growth and the environment, the rise in health spending, patenting, and international trade.nnThis course satisfies the GSB PhD macro requirement.
Terms: Aut | Units: 4
Instructors: Jones, C. (PI) ; Klenow, P. (SI)
Schedule for MGTECON 610
- ECON 210: Macroeconomics I
Dynamic programming applied to a variety of economic problems. These problems will be formulated in discrete or continuous time, with or without uncertainty, with a finite or infinite horizon. There will be weekly problem sets and a take-home final that will require MATLAB programming. Enrollment is limited to Econ PhD students for the first two weeks of open enrollment, after which the remaining space will be available to all other interested students.
Terms: Aut | Units: 2-5
Instructors: Piazzesi, M. (PI) ; Schneider, M. (PI)
