### Direction
- Choose macro as of now as could be useful for writing a thesis
- Micro is perhaps better for signalling but not useful for thesis/research paper
- GRE exams coming up, 
- AWSS, can take 4 courses, before application season. hopefully 4 to rewrite my masters outcome 

### Points to raise 
- want to take a course because of more research exposure
- want the signalling, masters result is imperfect, want to do macro related research, need to rewrite
- 

### Course list 
- MGTECON 610: Macroeconomics
This course covers various topics in macroeconomics and is designed to expose students to macroeconomic methods, classic papers in the field, and the latest research at the frontier. The current focus is on economic growth. Using theoretical and empirical tools, we consider questions like: How do we understand long-run growth in per capita income? Why are some countries so much richer than others? Other topics include misallocation as a source of TFP differences, the direction of technical change, growth and the environment, the rise in health spending, patenting, and international trade.nnThis course satisfies the GSB PhD macro requirement.
